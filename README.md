# Object Detection Using Faster R-CNN

## Introduction

This project demonstrates object detection using the Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm. The goal is to identify and localize objects of interest within a video stream. The objects are categorized into predefined classes (e.g., "background" and "object") based on a trained model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Python scripts:

1. `001_object_labeling.py`: This script allows you to label objects within a video by selecting regions of interest (ROIs) in each frame. It saves the labeled objects' coordinates and frames to a JSON file.

2. `002_preprocessing_pipeline.py`: This script preprocesses the labeled objects by resizing the frames and encoding bounding box coordinates.

3. `003_color_sampler.py`: In this script, you can sample colors from selected frames to define a color range for the object of interest. It calculates color statistics and saves color bounds to a JSON file.

4. `004_object_detection_training.py`: This script trains an object detection model using a labeled dataset and the color bounds obtained from the previous step. It uses Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 as the backbone for object detection.

5. `005_object_detection.py`: The final script loads the trained model and performs object detection on a video stream. Detected objects are drawn as bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores.

## Instructions

1. Run each script in the order listed above to label objects, preprocess data, sample colors, train the model, and perform object detection.

2. Modify the class labels and video file paths as needed for your specific application.

3. View the detected objects in real-time with bounding boxes and labels.

This project is inspired by the OpenAI GPT-3 chat example and demonstrates how to perform object detection tasks using a deep learning model.

Feel free to customize and extend this project to suit your specific object detection needs. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to the script comments and documentation for further guidance.
